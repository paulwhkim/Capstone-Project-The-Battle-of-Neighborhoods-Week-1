    "The Covid-19 virus pandemic has completely changed the landscape for New York City, perhaps forever. The borders were shut down for travelers. Tourism vanished overnight, something that New York City feeds on. While the pandemic situation is cataphrosphic for many (hospitals, existing business owners, the municpality, etc to name a few), it may present an interesting opportunity for future business investment. Specifically, whether or not it would be wise to open up a Ramen shop in New York City. The massive closures happening in New York City, paired with the ballooning city budget deficits, is providing cheaper rents and more favorable new lease terms. \n",
